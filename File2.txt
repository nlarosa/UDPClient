The NetScale laboratory is an effort by Dr. Aaron Striegel of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame. The goal of the wiki is to help capture our standard processes as well as provide an easier to access view of our various resources. While you are here, feel free to browse on over to our other wikis which include educational offerings and research papers that our group has discussed. For fun, you can catch the blog of Dr. Striegel here as well.
